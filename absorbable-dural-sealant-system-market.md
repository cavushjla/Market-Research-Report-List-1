<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Dural Sealant System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polyethylene Glycol (PEG)-Based</li><li>Fibrogen and Thrombin-Based</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The absorbable dural sealant system market includes three primary types: polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based sealants, fibrin-based sealants, and thrombin-based sealants. PEG-based sealants utilize a biocompatible polymer that facilitates adhesion and sealing during surgical procedures. Fibrin-based sealants mimic natural blood clotting, promoting tissue bonding and healing. Thrombin-based sealants work by activating the bodyâ€™s clotting cascade, enhancing the formation of fibrin and aiding in wound closure. Each type serves distinct surgical needs, emphasizing safety, effectiveness, and biocompatibility.</p></p>
