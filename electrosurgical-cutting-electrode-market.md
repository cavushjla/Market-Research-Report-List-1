<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electrosurgical Cutting Electrode Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Bipolar Electrosurgery</li><li>Monopolar Electrosurgery</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electrosurgical cutting electrode market is segmented into two primary types: bipolar and monopolar electrosurgery. Bipolar electrosurgery utilizes two electrodes to pass current directly through the tissue, allowing for more precise coagulation and reduced thermal spread, making it suitable for delicate procedures. Monopolar electrosurgery employs a single active electrode, with the current returning through a grounding pad, enabling broader tissue cutting and coagulation. Each type serves specific surgical needs, influencing the choice based on the procedure's requirements and safety considerations.</p></p>
